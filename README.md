  <p>The implementation process of this page involved the use of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Responsiveness in the page was achieved mainly using CSS3 media queries and transitions, ensuring optimization for different devices and screen sizes, providing an accessible and seamless user-experience.</p>
  <p>The other key feature in enhancing user engagement – an image carousel showcasing various plant decoration ideas – was designed and coded using JS.  The carousel includes buttons, with listeners that allow the user to scroll through the available images, easing the process of finding inspiration.</p>

  <h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
  <p><strong>Responsive Design</strong> - Creating this dynamic page provided an opportunity to employ the CSS3 and Javascript tools that enhance user experience. Additionally, with the page being an ecommerce site, I was challenged to work attentively, placing focus on an easily navigable and dynamic design.</p>
